The analysis focuses on sales performance, customer experience, and delivery accuracy, using various data science techniques including machine learning for delivery prediction and sentiment analysis. The results are visualized in a PowerBI dashboard, and a prediction tool is built with Streamlit to provide real-time sales and delivery date predictions.
